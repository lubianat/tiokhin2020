# Log of the code review by Tiago

Goals:

* Check if scripts  "Experimental_Manip..." and "RawPop..." match the verbal descriptions
* Find any bugs (if they exist)

Extra goals:
 
* Improve code reproducibility
* Optimize memory usage of "RawPop..."

# Step 0: 

I will start by cleaning and understanding what the code does.
In the process, I'll share my notes.

### "Experimental_Manip..."

* Some comments are clutter that can be removed for clarity. For example: 
    #load libraries
    #set sci ids
